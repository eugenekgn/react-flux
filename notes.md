### React notes

 * html should be a projection of app state not a source of turth 
 * unidirectional flow
 * inline styles can be good?
 * virtual dom 
 * can render on the client and the server (isomorphic)
 * react router 
 * flux - unidirectional (one way data flows) flow library


 * props - look like html attributes, but immutable, `this.props.username` // pass data to child via props
 * state - `this.state.username`
